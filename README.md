# spicycentral-template

Templates for spicycentral.org using Jinja2 for integration with the SpicyCMS backend.

SpicyCentral is a site for neurodivergent people and allies to share knowledge and grow a community around it.

It will have (eventually):

- articles
- blogs (potentially for admin and writers)
- videos
- forums
- code and apps (link to github or installers)
- online tools

The site will use bootstrap 5.3 as a base, along with videojs, and some custom js to help accessibility and support real-timeupdates via SSE or Websockets.

There are three variations of the template:

- standard - just a normal version of the page
- wide - designed for people with more screen real-estate (like me)
- focused - low stimulation version for people with neuro-divergence requirements.

In addition to these variants, there are a number of macros for things like:

- user profiles
- cards
- videojs videos
- youtube videos

...and more.
